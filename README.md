3D Structural Analysis Engine

Tool can create and build stiffness and (consistent) mass matrices of 3-Dimensional structures using finite element method. Frame elements and truss elements are available. 
Shell elements and bilinear 2d elements are going to be added. Eigen and Armadillo Libraries aare used as linear algebra solvers. It is up to user to pick one to use for
as solver

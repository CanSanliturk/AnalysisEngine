3D Structural Analysis Engine

Tool can create and build stiffness and (consistent) mass matrices of 3-Dimensional structures using finite element method. Frame elements and truss elements are available. 
Shell elements and bilinear 2d elements are going to be added. Eigen library is used as solver
